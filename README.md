This is my personal photoblog. It is a series of photos I've taken, with some basic tagging and metadata.

# Building

Make sure you have `blogctl` installed:

```bash
> go get -u github.com/wcharczuk/blogctl
```

Then you can build the site with:

```bash
> blogctl build
```

And serve a local copy with

```bash
> blogctl server
```
